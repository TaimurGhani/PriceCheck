# PriceCheck
- PriceCheck is a web app that allows users to compare prices from three major retailers using the Semantics3 API: Walmart, Target, and Amazon. 
  - This was the first projects I did as I was learning frontend web-dev
- Users can add the items they want to their wish list. 
- Each item displays a set of key data
  - Name
  - Price
  - Image
  - URL
- **Web App no longer works due to the api key expiring**
